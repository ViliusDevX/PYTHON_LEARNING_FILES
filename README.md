This repository contains my Python learning materials developed during the ITFightClub course (itfightclub.lt). 

I began this journey on April 11, 2023, with the goal of building a strong foundation in Python programming. 

The content here includes exercises, small projects, and notes I used while practicing until approximately December 15, 2024.

This work reflects my progress, experiments, and understanding of core Python concepts, and serves both as a personal archive and a resource for others who may be on a similar learning path.
